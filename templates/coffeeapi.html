    <h1>Coffee Shop API</h1>
<br><br>
<p><i>
The coffee shop API is a RESTful service that displays frontend information on coffee shops, and also offers this data from the API.

<br><br>

<br><br>
This API was built from two smaller projects - one which used an SQL database and one which stored data on a .csv file.
<br><br>
All aspects of the program that utilized a .csv file were re-written and adapted to the SQL database structure.
<br><br>
Postman was used to set up, test, and document the API. Arguments may be passed to retrieve specific data.
<br><br>
The coffee shop API was built as a project for this portfolio. The two smaller projects within it are designed and instructed by Dr. Angela Yu. You can view the code in its entirety here:
